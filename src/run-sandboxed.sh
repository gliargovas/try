# managing to mount overlay on root

# --mount: mounting and unmounting filesystems will not affect the rest
#          of the system inside the unshare
# --map-root-user: map to the superuser UID and GID in
#                  the newly created user namespace.
# --user: The process will have a distinct set of UIDs, GIDs and
#         capabilities.
# --pid: Create a new process namespace
#        KK: As far as I understand this is necessary so that 
#            procfs can be mounted and internal commands see it properly.
# --fork: Seems necessary if we do --pid
#        KK: Not sure why!

## TODO: Instead of running this code here always, we need to run
##       it inside orch.py and essentially find the W dependencies
##       of each command (which should also in theory be given by Riker).
##
##       Then, we need to commit changes only if these write dependencies are
##       independent from: 
##       (1)  the readset of the main command that was run without
##            the sandbox (the first command in the workset)   
##       (2)  the writeset of the main command (actually if they are
##            the same, we could just make sure to commit them in order).
